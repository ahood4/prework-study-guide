# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description
My motivation to create this project was to begin developing fundamental skills for web development including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. I built this project because it was a great opportunity to help learn and internalize basic concepts for these tools and web languages and put them into action by creating a simple web page. By doing so, I was able to solve the problem of not being familiar with these three coding languages as well as Git. This project allowed me to begin to understand how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together and how they can be employed alongside Git to create a functioning web page that can be published and viewed collaboratively with other developers.
